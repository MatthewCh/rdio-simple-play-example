An example of rdio-simple with Java and the Play! framework.

To play with it put your credentials in app/ConsumerCredentials.java
or set the RDIO_CONSUMER_KEY and RDIO_CONSUMER_SECRET environment variables.

For example, if you're using heroku, set your consumer key and consumer secret with:
  heroku config:set RDIO_CONSUMER_KEY=mykey
  heroku config:set RDIO_CONSUMER_SECRET=mysecret
